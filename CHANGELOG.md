I believe you must have used WebStorm before, and you probably find its log feature very comfortable. However, it seems that VS Code's code snippets don't fully support this kind of writing. So, I made it into a plugin.

# quickly start
you can write `a.log` and **Press the ctrl + Tab key** you can get `console.log('a',a)`
